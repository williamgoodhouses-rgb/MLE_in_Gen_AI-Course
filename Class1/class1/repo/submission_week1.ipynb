    "1.1 What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized open protocol designed to allow AI models (LLMs) to safely access external tools and resources. It defines a structured interface that tools must follow, enabling models to interact with:\n",

    "\n",
    "MCP provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "Security — precise control over what tools the model can access\n",
    "\n",
    "Interoperability — tools can be reused by different LLMs\n",

    "Extensibility — easy to add additional functions\n",

    "Simplicity — unifies tool-calling under one protocol\n",
